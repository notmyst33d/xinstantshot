Because KDE Spectacle wasnt fast enough

## Reasons NOT to use this thing
* Screenshots are saved to `$HOME/Pictures/Screenshots` by default, but this path can be changed by using `-p` parameter
* A lot of `unwrap()`, which produces cryptic errors
* Just dont, you will regret it

## CLI
`-c` - Save to clipboard  
`-p (path)` - Specify screenshot folder path
